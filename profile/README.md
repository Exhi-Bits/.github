# ExhiBit ðŸŽ¨

A platform for the artists around the world where you can start creating your NFTs and showcase them for auctions in one place, so that anyone can start working on their own **NFTs JUST LIKE THAT.**

## How we work

Users have reached a point where trading NFTs becomes an easy job just by scrolling through any NFT marketplaces. when they think of creating something even many artists had to go through some complex learning tutorials. By getting into ExhiBits they could start creating everything from online itself, from digital arts, 3D models and music. We know that these has values as a NFT where they can be used as collectibles to gamified NFTs and in the future where we will be flying through the Metaverse every thing like these counts. 

 We know that creating or designing complex 3D models online are far-fetched but we can work on basic models now. Hopping that everything will be possible in the near future. Projects like these can bring more users to get into Web3.

* Even little kids will be able to draw something on our platform. 
* Artworks can be community driven like any other social media every one could vote on the creations.
* Setting up as a DAO and by using own tokens everyone could bring their creations to the marketplace without any cost if that creation becomes the most voted or liked one in the platform.            


Bringing power and security back to people are the big fundamentals of Web3, as it has got this much adoption all along the world in this short time (not an easy job). Our next motive should be to onboard other users also into the Web3, other than Defi and games there should be projects that allow people to gather around and work along in this space. I think project like ExhiBit can bring people to get an interactive experience in Web3.
  
> The world deserves technology that can unlock opportunity for the millions on the margins of the innovation economy and enable people to take control of their digital lives.
 
A good idea will become **THE BEST**  only if there is a good team and persistent work is done efficiently.
